## Abstract

This workshop brings together researchers across disciplines to explore new insights into the dynamics and control of biological and medical systems. The program features five invited professors delivering 30-minute talks and seven junior faculty members presenting 20-minute talks, providing a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in modeling, analysis, and regulation of biological and medical systems.  

In addition, a panel discussion will focus on identifying open challenges in biological and medical systems and examining how perspectives from dynamics and control can contribute to addressing these problems and generating new scientific insight.
