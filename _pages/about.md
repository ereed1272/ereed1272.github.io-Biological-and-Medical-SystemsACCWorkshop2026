##Abstract: This workshop aims to bring together researchers working across disciplines to uncover insights into dynamics and control of biological and medical systems. Our workshop will feature 5 professors each with 30 minute talks and 7 junior faculty each with 20 minute talks to gain an understanding for the state-of-the-art in regulating biological and medical systems. Furthermore, our panel discussion will focus on uncovering the problems that still remain to be solved in biological and medical systems and how studying these problems from a dynamics and control perspective may help to provide new insight into these problems.
